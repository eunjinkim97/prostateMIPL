    <p> Prediction of BCR for Prostate MRI by using deep learning based algorithm </p>
    
### This code is about a study for analyzing prostate cancers using by deep learning and machine learning. The study was conducted by Eunjin Kim and Inye Na from the Medical Imaging Processing Lab led by Hyeonjin Park in 2021 from SKKU.

</h1>


## Overview
The code includes three main parts:

Preprocessing of MR images: This includes preprocessing of multi-parametric images (T1, T2, and T1 contrast-enhanced) of prostate MRIs.

Deep learning network for BCR prediction: This includes training a deep learning network to predict BCR by taking inputs as MR images mentioned above.

Survival model using machine learning techniques: This includes training a survival model using machine learning techniques.
